# genwspr

I wrote this code years ago, and only recently redusted it off.
I believe that it formed the basis of a number of projects (particularly embedded 
microcontrollers like the Arduino) that were used to form WSPR beacons.  It probably
has been superceded by more advanced code that can handle additional types of WSPR messages
(this only encodes the basic Type 1 messages).
